# The Improved Models Patch

Hi !

I had a while ago the idea of porting some Cataclysm m2s in WoW Classic. I first converted the models with tools found on Modcraft and fixed little things like textures to fit the 1.12 lighting system. 
Then I started my own tool, a[LKBC Converter](http://github.com/Koward/LKBC_Converter) in C, allowing me to go further in the process.
Now the models come from all extensions, from Burning Crusade to Warlords of Draenor.
I hope you'll enjoy it ;)
